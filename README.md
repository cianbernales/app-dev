## My favorite movie and series

### Movie
**Interstellar**
I like Interstellar because it’s an incredible movie and I like sci-fi genre as well. The way it explores space and time feels so vast and awesome at the same time, yet the story remains deeply personal. Also, Hans Zimmer’s music is unforgettable, and it makes every scene even more emotional and impactful.

### Series
**Attack on Titan**
I also like Attack on Titan because of its intense plot twists and the characters. It keeps me hooked with its mix of action, mystery, and meaningful storytelling. The themes of freedom and survival really hit hard, and the series has such a unique way of making you feel for the characters and their struggles.
